✅ STEP 1: Create Stripe Account & Get API Keys
Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/register and sign up or log in.

Open this link: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

Copy:

Publishable Key → pk_test_...

Secret Key → sk_test_...

Let’s keep these in a file later as .env or config.php.


✅ STEP 3: Install Stripe PHP SDK
Open Command Prompt (CMD)

Navigate to your project folder:

bash

cd C:\xampp\htdocs\stripe_payment
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
composer require stripe/stripe-php
❗ If you don’t have Composer installed: https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe


✅ STEP 10: (Optional) Email Receipt
Stripe sends email receipt automatically when you enable it:

Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/emails

✅ Enable “Successful payments”

✅ STEP 11: Test Payment
Check your Stripe test dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments

You’ll see the test transaction there.

🛠️ Fix (Optional): Enable zip Extension
You can fix this warning permanently in 2 minutes:

Open:

makefile

C:\xampp\php\php.ini
Find the line:



;extension=zip
and remove the semicolon (;):


extension=zip
Save the file.

Restart Apache and CMD.

To test, run:

bash

php -m

composer require stripe/stripe-php

Look for zip in the list.

This is optional but good for future composer installs.



✅ Stripe Dashboard to Verify
Visit: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
Here, you can view all test payments in real-time.

📩 Stripe Auto Email
Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/emails

✅ Turn ON:
